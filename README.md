# SWGOH-Raid_Scraper
PROJECT GOAL
We are looking to create a discord bot that
interacts with the Star Wars Galaxies API, as
well as the SWGOH.GG website to provide
information on guild events & activity. This
tool/bot will be used primarily to help track
guild member activity.
The Team:
Antonio Stefan
David Loerts
Sean Clarke
